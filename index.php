				<h1>The Onion: America's Finest News Source</h1>
					<p>The Onion is a satirical news outlet that is found on the web at <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">www.theonion.com</a>.
						The satirical content is composed of articles, graphics, videos, and headlines with a picture.
						The content is categorized in different sections based on the subject matter. The sections are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Video</li>
								<li>Politics</li>
								<li>Sports</li>
								<li>Local</li>
								<li>Business</li>
								<li>Entertainment</li>
								<li>Science & Technology</li>
								<li>After Birth</li>
							</ul>
				<h2>Data Design Analysis</h2>
					<p>For my data design project I will evaluate the usage scenarios for both a specific article and for a category.</p>
					<h3>Data Design Analysis Topics</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/bernie-sanders-repeatedly-scolded-attempting-union-51537" target="_blank">
									Bernie Sanders Repeatedly Scolded For Attempting To Unionize Debate Moderators</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/section/politics/" target="_blank">Onion Politics</a></li>
						</ol>
					<h3>Personas</h3>
						<p>A persona is a hypothetical written description of an end user who will use your product.
							Personas are used to model hypothetical use case scenarios for your product.For my data design analysis I have invented
							two personas that could potentially access America's Finest News Source</p>
							<ol>
								<li><h4>Persona 1</h4>
									<p>16-35 year old male who is tech savvy and has a good sense of humor and possibly politically leans to the left. Persona 1 actively seeks out and shares content, especially political satire,. probably accessed from a web browser or smart phone.</p>
									<h5>Use Scenario</h5>
									<ul><li>
											<p>Persona 1 is looking for funny political satire. If his search is successful he will share the page with his social media network.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li><h4>Persona 2</h4>
										<p>50-70 year old who is not tech savvy and might have been exposed to America's Finest News Source from a social media posting by a much younger relative.</p>
										<h5>Use Scenario</h5><ul><li>Persona 2 was browsing facebook when they noticed their grandson Persona 1, had posted a story about Bernie Sanders.Persona 2 wants to
											investigate the other political stories on this new website. In order to do this, Persona 2 must:
											<br><ol>
												<li>Click the link Persona 1 shared.</li>
												<li>Evaluate the story in the link and try to find the politics category</li>
												<li>Click the politics tag in the upper left of the page, next to the picture and below the headline.</li>
												<li>Scroll through articles until they realize they are truly reading America's Finest News Source</li>
											</ol></li></ul></li>
