						<p>A persona is a hypothetical written description of an end user who will use your product.
							Personas are used to model hypothetical use case scenarios for your product.For my data design analysis I have invented
							two personas that could potentially access America's Finest News Source</p>
							<ol>
								<li><h4>Persona 1</h4>
									<p>16-35 year old male who is tech savvy and has a good sense of humor and possibly politically leans to the left. Persona 1 actively seeks out and shares content, especially political satire,. probably accessed from a web browser or smart phone.</p>
									<h5>Use Scenario</h5>
									<ul><li>
											Persona 1 is looking for funny political satire. If his search is successful he will share the page with his social media network.In order to do this,
											Persona 1 must:
											<p><ol>
												<li>Open Web Browser</li>
												<li>Navigate to www.theonion.com</li>
												<li>Activate the drop down menu by clicking the button on the far left of the header.</li>
												<li>Mouse down past the search bar and video category, to politics.</li>
												<li>Click politics.</li>
												<li>Read article.</li>
												<li>Repeat steps 4-5 until they find a story worth sharing.</li>

												</ol></p></li></ul></li>
								<li><h4>Persona 2</h4>
										<p>50-70 year old who is not tech savvy and might have been exposed to America's Finest News Source from a social media posting by a much younger relative.</p>
										<h5>Use Scenario</h5><ul><li>Persona 2 was browsing Facebook when they noticed their grandson Persona 1, had posted a story critical of Bernie Sanders. Persona 2 knows Persona 1 is a dirty liberal commie, and wants to
											investigate the other political stories on this new website, and make a judgment about the quality of this new website. In order to do this, Persona 2 must:
											<p><ol>
												<li>Click the link Persona 1 shared.</li>
												<li>Evaluate the story in the link and try to find the politics category.</li>
												<li>Click the politics tag in the upper left of the page, next to the picture and below the headline.</li>
