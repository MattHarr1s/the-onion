				<h1>The Onion: America's Finest News Source</h1>
					<p>The Onion is a satirical news outlet that is found on the web at <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">www.theonion.com</a>.
						The satirical content is composed of articles, graphics, videos, and headlines with a picture.
						The content is categorized in different sections based on the subject matter. The sections are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Video</li>
								<li>Politics</li>
								<li>Sports</li>
								<li>Local</li>
								<li>Business</li>
								<li>Entertainment</li>
								<li>Science & Technology</li>
								<li>After Birth</li>
							</ul>
				<h2>Data Design Analysis</h2>
					<p>For my data design project I will evaluate the usage scenarios for both a specific article and for a category.</p>
					<h3>Data Design Analysis Topics</h3>

					<h4>Personas</h4>
						<p>A persona is a hypothetical written description of an end user who will use your product.
							Personas are used to model hypothetical use case scenarios for your product.For my data design analysis I have invented
							two personas that could potentially access America's Finest News Source</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Persona 1
									<p>16-35 year old male who is tech savvy and has a good sense of humor and possibly politically leans to the left. Persona 1 actively seeks out and shares content, especially political satire,. probably accessed from a web browser or smart phone.</p></li>
								<li>Persona 2</li>
							</ol>
