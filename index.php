				<h1>The Onion: America's Finest News Source</h1>
					<p>The Onion is a satirical news outlet that is found on the web at <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">www.theonion.com</a>.
						The satirical content is composed of articles, graphics, videos, and headlines with a picture.
						The content is categorized in different sections based on the subject matter. The sections are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Video</li>
								<li>Politics</li>
								<li>Sports</li>
								<li>Local</li>
								<li>Business</li>
								<li>Entertainment</li>
								<li>Science & Technology</li>
								<li>After Birth</li>
							</ul>
				<h2>Data Design Analysis</h2>
					<p>For my data design project I will evaluate the usage scenarios for both a specific article and for a category. The steps listed in the use scenario are for the personas, however if you hover your mouse cursor over the steps, you will see the action the website is taking.</p>
					<h3>Data Design Analysis Subjects</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/bernie-sanders-repeatedly-scolded-attempting-union-51537" target="_blank">
									Bernie Sanders Repeatedly Scolded For Attempting To Unionize Debate Moderators</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.theonion.com/section/politics/" target="_blank">Onion Politics</a></li>
						</ol>
					<h3>Personas</h3>
						<p>A persona is a hypothetical written description of an end user who will use your product.
							Personas are used to model hypothetical use case scenarios for your product.For my data design analysis I have invented
							two personas that could potentially access America's Finest News Source</p>
							<ol>
								<li><h4>Stefon</h4>
									<img src="img/stefon.jpg" alt="Stefon the Barista">
									<p>Stefon is a 16-35 year old male who is tech savvy and has a good sense of humor and possibly politically leans to the left. Stefon actively seeks out and shares content, especially political satire, probably accessed from a web browser or smart phone.</p>
									<h5>Use Scenario</h5>
									<ul><li>
											Stefon just cracked open a fresh growler of craft session IPA. The only fitting way to relax after a long day's work creating artisanal graphics and logos
											in the free-range design studio at the local print shop. After Stefon locks up his 1968 vintage Schwinn that he personally modified with a fixed axle, he loves drinking a locally sourced craft beer and sitting down at his 2012 MacBook Pro, where he spends his miserable life stirring up political drama onFacebook. In order to do this,
											Stefon must:
											<p><ol>

								<li><h4>Grandma Sally</h4>
										<img src="img/sallyonion.jpg" alt="What's This Onion?">
										<p>Grandma Sally is a 50-70 year old female who, sadly, was born about 50 years too late to be tech savvy. Because of this she has not been exposed to America's Finest News Source.</p>
										<h5>Use Scenario</h5><ul><li>Sally was browsing Facebook when she noticed a post made by her grandson Stefon, of a news article critical of Bernie Sanders. If there's one thing Grandma Sally knows her Grandson Stefon,
											it's that he is a dirty liberal commie who would never criticize his savior, Bernie Sanders.Because of this new-found idiosyncrasy in Stefon,
											Grandma Sally is now hell-bent on examining this so called Onion to find out what it did to her Grandson. In order to do this, Grandma Sally must:
											<p><ol>
												<li><span title="www.facebook.com opens a new browser window containing the contents of the link in the story above">Excitedly click the link Stefon shared.</span></li>
												<li><span title="website chills">Evaluate the story in the link and try to find the politics category.</span></li>
