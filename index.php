				<h1>The Onion: America's Finest News Source</h1>
					<p>The Onion is a satirical news outlet that is found on the web at <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">www.theonion.com</a>.

								<li>Entertainment</li>
								<li>Science & Technology</li>

							</ul>
				<h2>Data Design Analysis</h2>
					<p>For my data design project I will evaluate the usage scenarios for both a specific article and for a category. The steps listed in the use scenario are for the personas, <h3> however if you hover your mouse cursor over the steps, you will see the action the website is taking.</h3></p>
					<h3>Data Design Analysis Subjects</h3>

					<h3>Personas</h3>
						<p>A persona is a hypothetical written description of an end user who will use your product.
							Personas are used to model hypothetical use case scenarios for your product.For my data design analysis I have invented
							two personas that could potentially access America's Finest News Source</p>

								<li><h4>Stefon</h4>
									<img src="img/stefon.jpg" alt="Stefon the Barista">
									<p>Stefon is a 16-35 year old male who is tech savvy with a good sense of humor. When it come to politics, there is no doubt that Stefon leans to the left. Stefon actively seeks out and shares content, from the screen of his MacBook Pro or his iOs device.
									<h5>Use Scenario</h5>
									<ul><li>
											Stefon just cracked open a fresh growler of La Cumbre Elevated IPA. The only fitting way to relax after a long day's work creating artisanal graphics and logos
											in the free-range design studio at the local print shop. After Stefon locks up his 1968 vintage Schwinn that he personally modified with a fixed axle, he loves drinking La Cumbre Elevated IPA, which is a locally sourced craft beer and sitting down at his 2012 MacBook Pro,
											where he spends his miserable life stirring up political drama on Facebook. There are several steps Stefon must take in order to accomplish his goal. These steps are listed in a table below, with the corresponding actions taken by the Onion website.

								<li><h4>Grandma Sally</h4>
										<img src="img/sallyonion.jpg" alt="What's This Onion?">
										<p>Grandma Sally is a 50-70 year old female who, sadly, was born about 50 years too late to be tech savvy. A few year ago her Grandson Stefon bought her a macbook which she uses to browse Facebook and read the news.
											Because Sally isn't not very tech savvy, she usually only finds new websites through posts made by her Facebook friends.</p>
										<h5>Use Scenario</h5><ul><li>After an afternoon of watching Judge Judy stick it to some freeloaders, Sally decided to open up her laptop and browse Facebook. After several minutes of liking pictures of her neighbor's grandson, she noticed a headline demonizing Bernie Sanders for attempting to unionize debate moderators.
											Upoon further investigation Sally realizes the post was made by her grandson Stefon. If there's one thing Grandma Sally knows her Grandson Stefon,
											it's that he is a dirty liberal commie who would never criticize his savior, Bernie Sanders. Because of this new-found idiosyncrasy in Stefon,
											Grandma Sally is now hell-bent on examining this so called Onion to find out what it did to her Grandson. In order to do this, Grandma Sally must:
