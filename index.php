				<ul>
					<!-Stefon the Barista->
					<li><h3>Stefon</h3></li>
					<img src="img/stefon.jpg" alt="Stefon the Barista">
					<p>Stefon is a 16-35 year old male who is tech savvy with a good sense of humor. When it come to politics
					, there is no doubt that Stefon leans to the left. Stefon actively seeks out and shares content from
					the screen of his MacBook Pro or his iOs device.
				</ul>
					<!-Use scenario for Stefon the Barista->
					<h2>Use Scenario</h2>
					<p>Stefon just cracked open a fresh growler of La Cumbre Elevated IPA. The only fitting way to relax
					after a long day's work creating artisanal graphics and logos in the free-range design studio at the
					local print shop. After Stefon locks up his 1968 vintage Schwinn that he personally modified with a fixed
					axle, he loves drinking La Cumbre Elevated IPA, which is a locally sourced craft beer and sitting down
					with his 2012 MacBook Pro, where he spends his miserable life stirring up political drama on Facebook.</p><br>
					<p>There are several steps Stefon must take in order to accomplish his goal. These steps are listed in
					the table below, with the corresponding actions taken by the Onion website.</p>

					<p>Grandma Sally is a 50-70 year old female who, sadly, was born about 50 years too late to be tech
						savvy. A few year ago her Grandson Stefon bought her a macbook which she uses to browse Facebook and
						read the news. Because Sally isn't not very tech savvy, she usually only finds new websites through
						posts made by her Facebook friends.

				<h2>Use Scenario</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>After an afternoon of watching Judge Judy stick it to some freeloaders, Sally decided to open up her
						laptop and browse Facebook. After several minutes of liking pictures of her neighbor's grandson, she
						noticed a headline demonizing Bernie Sanders for attempting to unionize debate moderators.
					Upon further investigation Sally realizes the post was made by her grandson Stefon. If there's one thing
					Grandma Sally knows her Grandson Stefon,it's that he is a dirty liberal commie who would never criticize
						his savior, Bernie Sanders. Because of this new-found idiosyncrasy in Stefon,Grandma Sally is now
						hell-bent on examining this so called Onion to find out what it did to her Grandson. In order to do
						this, Grandma Sally must:
